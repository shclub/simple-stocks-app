DB Updating Table Dev Challenge
===============================

This module contains a development challenge for DB recruitment.

The instructions are in the site/index.html file.

To view them, run

```
npm install
npm start
```

from within this directory.  This will start a development server (using webpack)
that supports hot reloading but also provides a stomp/ws endpoint providing fake
fx updates.

Once you've started the development server, navigate to http://localhost:8011
to read the task description and get started.
